    "## Questions\n",
    "The four questions I'm basing my hypotheses on are:<br>\n",
    "- [**Question 1**](#question_1): Does discount amount have a statistically significant effect on the quantity of a product in an order? If so, at what level(s) of discount?<br>\n",
    "- [**Question 2**](#question_2): Do employees have a statistically significant effect on order values? If so, does the employee's region have a statistically significant effect?<br>\n",
    "- [**Question 3**](#question_3): Does the customer's region have a statistically significant impact on the amount of orders they submit?<br>\n",
    "- [**Question 4**](#question_4): Did items that are now discontinued have a statistically significant difference on order values?<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "With each question, I formulated at least one Null Hypothesis and at least one Alternate Hypothesis. From there I gathered the data using a combination of SQL and Pandas to group it appropriately and make it more easily readable and pliable. I then created a few visualizations to allow an eyeballing of the data, and determined the normality of the distributions.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "From there, if necessary, I pulled sample distributions to improve the normality, double-checked it, then checked the variances to determine which T-Test would best fit that dataset. I then ran the necessary tests including Student's T-Test, Welch's T-Test, ANOVA, and TUKEY to determine whether or not the Null Hypothesis was rejected. Finally, I formed my conclusion and recommendations based on the results of those tests, including any secondary run-throughs of the data if more than one hypothesis was formulated to answer the initial question."
